# Workday Manager
---
## Description

This Workday Manager lets you type dirrectly into the time slot and when you save it saves the text into local storage so next time you enter the website it saves the info. Throughout the day the color dynamically changes the timeslots to Past (gray), Present (red), Future (green).


## Usage
---
Enter your text/notes/scheduled events into the time slots, click the save icon on the right of the text to come back later to your notes.

I had a problem with the timer, locally everything worked great but when I uploaded it i was getting all types of errors. I kept fixing error after error only to circle back, I left the timer but I couldnt get it to work on the uploaded page. CORRECTION; The timer works when it wants hopefully it works for you.
